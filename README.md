#  Unicorn Data Analytics Project

##  Overview
The **Unicorn Data Analytics Project** focuses on analyzing global startup companies that have achieved **unicorn status** â€” privately held startups valued at **over $1 billion**.  
Using Python for **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Power BI** for visualization, this project aims to uncover insights into investment trends, valuation growth, industry distribution, and geographic dominance in the startup ecosystem.

---

##  Objective
The goal of this project is to:
- Analyze trends in unicorn startups based on valuation, funding, and founding year.
- Identify which **industries, countries, and investors** dominate the unicorn landscape.
- Visualize key metrics and growth patterns through **interactive dashboards**.
- Gain insights into how the startup ecosystem has evolved over time.

---

##  Tools & Technologies Used
###  **Python (for EDA)**
- **Libraries:**  
  `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `plotly`
- **Tasks Performed:**  
  - Data cleaning and transformation  
  - Handling missing and inconsistent values  
  - Exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
  - Statistical summary and data visualization  

###  **Power BI (for Dashboard)**
- Created an **interactive dashboard** to visualize:  
  -  Industry-wise unicorn distribution  
  -  Country and continent-wise analysis  
  -  Top-valued unicorn companies  
  -  Trends by founding year and funding type  
  -  Top investors contributing to unicorn growth  

---

##  Data Source
The dataset was obtained from **public startup datasets** available on platforms like:
- [Kaggle â€“ Unicorn Companies Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)  

The dataset includes attributes such as:
- Company name  
- Country and city of origin  
- Industry sector  
- Date joined the unicorn list  
- Valuation (in billions)  
- Funding amount and investors  
- Year founded  

---

##  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The EDA was performed using **Python** to identify patterns, relationships, and anomalies within the dataset.

###  Key Steps
1. **Data Cleaning** â€“ Removing duplicates, handling missing values, and formatting dates.  
2. **Feature Engineering** â€“ Creating derived features like company age, funding-to-valuation ratio, etc.  
3. **Descriptive Analysis** â€“ Summarizing data with statistics and group-wise insights.  
4. **Visualization** â€“ Using Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Plotly to create:
   - Bar and Pie charts for industry and country breakdown  
   - Line charts for unicorn growth trends over the years  
   - Scatter plots to visualize valuation vs funding correlation  
   - Heatmaps for identifying data relationships

##  Power BI Dashboard Highlights
The **Power BI dashboard** provides a dynamic and interactive overview of the unicorn dataset.

###  Dashboard Features
-  **Global Unicorn Map:** Distribution of unicorns across the world  
-  **Industry Insights:** Top-performing industries and valuation comparisons  
-  **Timeline View:** Year-wise growth of unicorn companies  
-  **Top Investors:** Key investors contributing to multiple unicorns
